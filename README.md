_Oke is currently a protoype, and does nothing of any use, I am using it to test ideas I have for the UX of this sort of tool, it may or may not ever become a real thing_

## Fun Fact

Ê°∂ (Oke) is a Japanese word that describes a tub, barrel or container.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'oke'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

To get started with oke, you can run `oke init` to setup the config files that the tool uses.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
